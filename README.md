Getting Started with Netwire and SDL
=====================================================

Code to accompany my blog post "Getting Started with Netwire and SDL"

To run these examples, you will need SDL development libraries installed, and
then you should be able to just run:

    cabal install --only-dependencies .
    cabal configure
    cabal build

You can run each of the examples with:

* `dist/build/Challenge1/Challenge1`
* `dist/build/Challenge2/Challenge2`
* `dist/build/Challenge3/Challenge3`
